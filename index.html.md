       <h2><u>volleyball</u></h2>
       <p>   Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. 
           Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.
           The complete set of rules are extensive, but play essentially proceeds as follows:
            a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), 
            from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court.
             The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court.
              The team may touch the ball up to 3 times, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively.
               Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack, 
               an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court.</p>

        <h3>there are several ways to fault and loose the points</h3>
        <ul><i>
         
            <li>Hitting the volleyball illegally - you must strike the ball in a manner such that you don't hold the ball or palm, carry, or throw it.</li> 
            <li>Stepping over or on the line while serving</li>
            <li>Not hitting the ball over the net</li>
            <li>Touching the net</li>
            <li>Reaching under the net and interfering with a player or the ball</li>
           <li> Not serving in the correct order</li>
           <li> Hitting the volleyball out of bounds</li>
            <li>Double hitting - when the same player hits the ball twice in a row</li>
            <li>Hitting the ball more than 3 times</li>
